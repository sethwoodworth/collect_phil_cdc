cdc scraping notes:

code
    where we are
        parse and scrape work fine
    where we're going
        indexer function
            watching the database for inserts
            watching file downloads
            knows how to restart if things die
        database read
        check_hires
            check if we've downloaded the hires and lores versions of a file
        smarter large-download code
        flag that's like "list what you have"
        flag that's like "fill in the gaps"
        parser should be smarter about grabbing categories
        publish to twitter

        1) pywikipediabot to upload
        2) ability to update with new canonicalized source
