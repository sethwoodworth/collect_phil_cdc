what?
we are interested in recaliming data that we believe to already be ours. These are data that we in theory "own" or "are free to use," but which is nonetheless difficult to access. 

right now, we have two main areas of focus:
*liberating media and data that are free of copyright restriction, such as those media and data which are owned by the federal government.
in many cases, these data are available online, but through unwieldy interfaces that enforce a certain type of use. For example, there is usually no option to download the entire data set in on go, without stepping through by hand.  These websites also often do not provide "permalinks," so that it's difficult or impossible to link someone to a piece of media or data that you found on their website.
*liberating media and data that you input or accrue on a website operated by someone else, such as a social networking website or an online word processor.
some of these websites have useful export features, and others don't
