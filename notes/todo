seth:
    sql query
        quickfix for now, until someone tells us how to be better at databases

parker:
    threading
    parser is smarter--
        remove td tags surrounding a couple things
        knows if we're looking at the page for an id that doesn't exist

code to find highest index on their db
    search for space char, parse out first result from their results page
running analytics on the data so we have some stuff for the site/press release
emails/phone calls asking for sponsorship
press release, website domain name
    write the press release and stuff now, but sit on it until we can try to get some sponsorships
clean up the code:
    better commenting.  better var names.  
    WRITE A README
code to step through the db and see where we have holes.
    also through the file structure
code to take our list of things that failed before, and make sure that they're all empty things.
code to add metadata that isn't reported but is accessible from search
    color
    video
DONE?: database: handle the case where we get id collisions
parser: better representation of categories?





cdc scraping notes:

code
    where we are
        parse and scrape work fine
    where we're going
        indexer function
            watching the database for inserts
            watching file downloads
            knows how to restart if things die
        database read
        check_hires
            check if we've downloaded the hires and lores versions of a file
        smarter large-download code
        flag that's like "list what you have"
        flag that's like "fill in the gaps"
        parser should be smarter about grabbing categories
        publish to twitter
    
upload
    wikicommons
        1) pywikipediabot to upload
        2) ability to update with new canonicalized source
        ian will help

        not until we're official, says seth
        email to cdc first
